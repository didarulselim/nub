                      In 2002, a group of eminent academics recognized this exponential increase in demand and established Northern University Bangladesh on 17 October in order to bring quality education within the reach of students with modest economic means. Sponsored and founded by International Business Agriculture & Technology (IBAT) Trust now known as NUB Trust (NUBT), a registered, non-political, non-profit voluntary organization, NUB made its foray in to the field of higher education and established itself as a center for excellence.                       
                      <br><br>  
                      Presently Northern University Bangladesh (NUB) has 5 Faculties situated within the Dhaka Metropolitan city with its Permanent Campus near Haji camp at Ashkona, Dakshin Khan. NUB has affiliations & accreditations with international institutions in its effort to provide education that can provide students with all the tools needed to face the challenges in any chosen career from any specialized field & the global industry. NUB has been authorized to confer degrees and certificates in all branches of knowledge including Business, Arts & Humanities, Science and Engineering, Law, Pharmacy and Public Health within the levels that includes Bachelors, Masters & is in the process of acquiring the level of M Phil & Ph.

                      <br><br>  
                      Northern University Bangladesh is now owned and managed by a group of academics under the illustrious and reputable banner of NUB Trust, who intend to not only provide higher education to the deserving students with moderate means but also aims to mould individuals with a specific skill set along with the value of social responsibility.

                      Scientists have invented many theories for the benefit of mankind and engineers have applied those theories for the service of human beings. Electrical & Electronic Engineering has developed as a consequence of this activity. Presently EEE is the root of all programs like electronics and communication engineering, computer science and engineering and information technology.

                      Guilty feelings about clothes are totally unnecessary. A lot of people earn their living by making clothes, so you should never feel bad. <br>

                      The production of textiles is a craft whose speed and scale of production has been altered almost beyond recognition by industrialization and the introduction of modern manufacturing technique. In fact the RMG sector has been known to have widely contributed to the GDP of Bangladesh in the form of foreign earning & has played a great role towards women empowerment by creating countless job which builds towards the socio-economic development at the grass root levels. From spinning to weaving, from knitwear to leisurewear and high street fashions, the textiles and clothing industry is Bangladesh’s biggest export earner, therefore the scope for those who are interested in acquiring a degree in textile engineering is immense & highly lucrative. <br><br>
 
                      The BSTE program at NUB has been designed to cover the key areas of textile engineering such as chemical processing, textile product engineering, information system design & machine design.
                      The Department of Textile Engineering offers a 4-year bachelor degree on ‘Bachelor in Textile Engineering’. To become a graduate in this field one has to complete 164 credit hours. <br><br>
                      To meet up the growing demand and challenges of the textile sector NUB introduced this program with a view to meet up the requirement of quality Textile Engineers at home and abroad. <br><br>
                      ‘Hi-Tech' is an accurate description of today's textile industry, with output embracing not only clothing and household items, but also an increasing range of diverse industrial and
                      leisure products To meet up the demand of different types of textile products, Textile Engineering has developed in our country as well as abroad.
