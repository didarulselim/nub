In the current world, where communication is a key in professional field, it can translate one’s thoughts & idea into neatly constructed sentences. Being a part of the debating club it can provide the student the basic training ground. In our highly competitive world it is important to be able to present the ideas in a logical and convincing manner and debating helps to put forward logical thoughts to other. Introduction structure & rules for exchange can provide the necessary tools to further their communication skills through extensive training & inter-university debating competition. <br><br>

Formal debating introduces structure and rules to an exchange of opinions, giving each participant equal opportunity to present their side of the issue while attempting to prove the opposing side false. The primary commitment of the NUB Debating Club is therefore to help its members improve these skills through extensive training programs and inter-University (including international) competitions, where we test our skills against the debaters from other institutions. We see the external competitions as both an opportunity to demonstrate our prowess, and learn from everyone else. At these debate competitions, you will meet some of the finest speakers of our generation.                        </p>

Motto:  `Be nice to wards. Chances are you'll end up working for one.’ Bill Gates, founder and former CEO of Microsoft. <br><br>

Information Technology (IT) is the acquisition, processing, storage and dissemination of vocal, pictorial, textual and numerical information by a microelectronics based combination of computing and telecommunications. The term in its modern sense first appeared in a 1958 article published in the Harvard Business Review, in which authors Leavitt and Whisler commented that "the new technology does not yet have a single established name. We shall call it information technology." <br><br>

The IT Club is for the students, faculty members and staff who enjoy computers, programming, creating web page and like to geek-out, talk/learn and communicate. The objective is to provide assistance to the students and faculty regarding current IT systems (i.e. help sessions, correspondence, etc.). It is the goal of the NUB IT Club to strive to create an environment conducive to the study in the respective field i.e. computer and telecommunication science. It facilitates members in obtaining materials (reference or other) that reinforce or augment materials presented in the classroom and/or assigned readings. The NUB IT Club shall conduct monthly meetings for the members. In addition to these meetings, seminars related to the field of computer and telecommunication science shall be organized if desired by the members. The NUB IT Club will facilitate (through guidance, funding, etc.) special interest groups for those members of the Club who wish to focus on a particular area of interest.    </p>
