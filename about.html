                      In 2002, a group of eminent academics recognized this exponential increase in demand and established Northern University Bangladesh on 17 October in order to bring quality education within the reach of students with modest economic means. Sponsored and founded by International Business Agriculture & Technology (IBAT) Trust now known as NUB Trust (NUBT), a registered, non-political, non-profit voluntary organization, NUB made its foray in to the field of higher education and established itself as a center for excellence.                       
                      <br><br>  
                      Presently Northern University Bangladesh (NUB) has 5 Faculties situated within the Dhaka Metropolitan city with its Permanent Campus near Haji camp at Ashkona, Dakshin Khan. NUB has affiliations & accreditations with international institutions in its effort to provide education that can provide students with all the tools needed to face the challenges in any chosen career from any specialized field & the global industry. NUB has been authorized to confer degrees and certificates in all branches of knowledge including Business, Arts & Humanities, Science and Engineering, Law, Pharmacy and Public Health within the levels that includes Bachelors, Masters & is in the process of acquiring the level of M Phil & Ph. D. in collaboration with foreign universities.                      
                      <br><br>  
                      Northern University Bangladesh is now owned and managed by a group of academics under the illustrious and reputable banner of NUB Trust, who intend to not only provide higher education to the deserving students with moderate means but also aims to mould individuals with a specific skill set along with the value of social responsibility.

                      It is with great pride and immense pleasure that I watch Northern University Bangladesh as it treads to attain the highest ranking status with its center of excellence in the field of higher education in Bangladesh. The 17 October 2002 marked the beginning of a trailblazing journey for this prestigious institution along with a group of highly qualified and illustrious educationists of the country. Since then, these educationists have been tirelessly working towards one goal- to provide higher education to the citizens of the nation that is at par with globally accepted standards in a dynamic academic landscape. <br><br>

                       

                      When I had taken on the role as Chairperson, Northern University Bangladesh Trust, I felt incredibly humbled and inspired to see that an institution can consistently produce a service/product that is not only deemed to be of premium quality in the higher education arena and cater to only some of our brightest minds, yet also keep higher education within the reach for students who come from modest economic backgrounds. To do so is not an easy task, as it requires a constant focus on the rapid changes that is resultant from the combined forces of tremendous technological advancement and free enterprise. Everything from radical innovations in communications, the explosion of the WORLD WIDE WEB, the opening of several new avenues for commerce such as Event management, Activation, Direct marketing, Business Process Outsourcing and many more, has completely changed the face of the global economy. This has resulted in us finally being classified as world citizens. Taking all these elements into account, I commend the Vice Chancellor and our team of highly qualified staff & teachers, for effectively keeping in pace with these changes. Needless to say, without their efforts to keep up with the rest of the world, we as a nation would seriously fall behind.

                       <br><br>

                      At Northern University Bangladesh, we aim to provide our student with an education that is absolutely relevant to today’s world and constantly update our curricula to incorporate them. We believe in providing higher education that will not only equip the student with all the necessary tools and skills to excel in their chosen fields but that which can also facilitate innovation leading towards socio-economic empowerment, which will subsequently build a brighter future for Bangladesh as a nation.

                       <br><br>

                      To the future students of Northern University Bangladesh, make use of this time at your university to explore your talents, seize the day everyday at NUB and absorb all the knowledge you may receive from our capable teachers. This is a crucial time in your lives where you decide how you plan to navigate your journey in life and who you wish to be. I would like to implore our younger generation to keep in mind that in their future lives and careers, it is imperative to remember that they have a duty towards their country and that they must incorporate social responsibility into their future endeavors. This will not only benefit them as individuals by building character, but will benefit society as a whole. <br><br>

                        Our pedagogy is modern as well as student friendly, our class room facilities are of international standard and our faculty members are world class. In this world of cut throat competition and cutting edge technology we have taken the challenge to groom our students with the skill which they can use from the day one as they enter into the job market or build their own enterprise. <br><br>

                         

                        In line with the goal of the university  to create, disseminate and store new knowledge, we emphasize on teaching, undertaking research and regular publication  in our university. All our campuses are well equipped with technology driven teaching aids, and all our scientific labs are providing excellent research opportunities both for students and the faculty members. Equal research facilities are also available for the business school and social science students and faculty members. We also regularly publish journals from all the faculties of the universities which are blind refereed. We patronize with great care case research for the business and the law students.

                         <br><br>

                        We are compliant to government and UGC rules  and our permanent campus is now being built with all the facilities of a modern campus and we hope to move there within a foreseeable future. It may be mentioned here that part of our permanent campus is already operational with some of the departments of science faculty  holding their classes regularly in that campus.  <br><br>

                         

                        The economy of Bangladesh is growing steadily and the private sector is  now hyper active due to supportive government policies . We now require regular flow of young and skilled graduates to run the enterprises coming up in the country. NUB is working relentlessly to provide this service for our economy.  <br><br>

                         

                         We believe on the basic values of the society and  the spirit of our glorious liberation war and remember with gratitude the sacrifices of our martyrs and the valiant freedom struggle of our people under the legendary leadership of our father of the nation Bangabandhu Shaikh Mujibur Rahman. We want our graduates to reflect these values and be the standard bearer of their almamater in whatever capacity they are serving  in future.     <br><br>
